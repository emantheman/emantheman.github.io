### My Online Portfolio!
Written from scratch using Create React App, in part to gain more familiarity with the tool. A successful experiment imo. All components authored by me excepting:
1. the LightBox import used to display images in ```*/other/art``` and
2. the tic-tac-toe game in ```*/code/tictactoe``` for which I loosely followed facebook's react tutorial; though I improved upon it massively (adding: win/lose/tie UI feedback; my own styles and logic; and an unbeatable computer opponent that uses the minimax algorithm) so much so that I feel comfortable calling it my own.

There's a lot more to add, but I'm ready to get it up and running. Let me know what you think!
